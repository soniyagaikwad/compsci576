# Math Mission: Arithmetic Assault
Our idea for the video game is to make a first-person shooter, but the enemies will be simple math operations (multiplication, subtraction, addition, division), and you will shoot them with the correct answer number. The goal would be to reach the end of a level while surpassing enemies and obstacles along the way.
