# Math Mission: Arithmetic Attack
The concept of our game was to make a first-person shooter game in which the enemies will be simple math operations (multiplication, subtraction, addition, division), and the player shoots them with the correct answer number. The goal of the game is to reach the end of a level while surpassing enemies and obstacles along the way.
